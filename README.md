## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Iâ€™m currently diving into the world of JASP,
Iâ€™m pursuing a minor in Machine Learning.
In addition, Iâ€™m learning Dutch and Russian to deepen my understanding of Europe from a linguistic perspective.
I'm a movie maniac and one of my all-time favorites is â€˜Les quatre cents coupsâ€™
For future study and career, I aspire to delve into the fields where science intersects (e.g. AI) with arts in all forms.
